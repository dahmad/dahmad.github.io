I want this to be a place for me to write "book reports" on textbook chapters and academic papers I read.

These articles will likely serve as a poor learning resource for others since their primary purpose is for me to learn through summarization.

Perhaps, these may whet the supposed reader's appetite to read the primary sources.

Happy holidays!
Donnie
