<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p><strong>1. This article introduces a class of first-order stationary time-varying Pitman-Yor processes.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What is Pitman-Yor process? --&gt; "In probability theory, a Pitman-Yor process . . . is a stochastic process whose sample path is a probability distribution" <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitman–Yor_process">(src)</a></p>
<ul>
<li>What is a stochastic process? --&gt; " . . . a mathematical object usually defined as a collection of random variables . . . widely used as mathematical models of systems and phenomena that appear to vary in a random manner" <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_process">(src)</a></li>
<li>What is a sample path? --&gt; "Any set of possible values to which the appropriate random variables determined by a stochastic process might map a given point in the sample space, taken over all values of the index space (often regarded as time)." <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sample_path">(src)</a></li>
<li>What is a probability distribution? --&gt; "a description of a random phenomenon in terms of the probabilities of events" <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution">(src)</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is a time-varying process? --&gt; " . . . a system in which certain quantities governing the system's behavior change with time, so that the system will respond differently to the same input at different times." <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-variant_system">(src)</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is a stationary process? --&gt; " . . . a stochastic process whose unconditional joint probability distribution does not change when shifted in time. Consequently, parameters such as mean and variance also do not change over time." <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_process">(src)</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is a first-order process? --&gt; "A first-order process is one whose dynamics can be represented by a first-order differential equation" <a href="http://www.online-courses.vissim.us/Strathclyde/firstorder_equations.htm">(src)</a></p>
<ul>
<li>What is a first-order differential equation? --&gt; " . . . an equation in which ƒ(x, y) is a function of two variables defined on a region in the xy-plane. The equation is of first order because it involves only the first derivative dy dx (and not higher-order derivatives)." <a href="http://www.math.hawaii.edu/~jamal/tuc01alt_desupps.pdf">(src)</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Subsuming our construction of time-varying Dirichlet processes presented in (Caron et al., 2007), these models can be used for time-dynamic density estimation and clustering.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What does subsuming mean? --&gt; "to include or place within something larger or more comprehensive : encompass as a subordinate or component element" <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/subsume">(src)</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is a Dirichlet process? --&gt; " . . . a probability distribution whose range is itself a set of probability distributions. It is often used in Bayesian inference to describe the prior knowledge about the distribution of random variables—how likely it is that the random variables are distributed according to one or another particular distribution." <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_process">(src)</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is density estimation? --&gt; " . . . the construction of an estimate, based on observed data, of an unobservable underlying probability density function." <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_estimation">(src)</a></p>
<ul>
<li>What is a probability density function? --&gt; " . . . a function, whose value at any given sample (or point) in the sample space (the set of possible values taken by the random variable) can be interpreted as providing a relative likelihood that the value of the random variable would equal that sample." <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function">(src)</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Our intuitive and simple construction relies on a generalized Polya urn scheme.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What is a Polya urn scheme? --&gt; a mental model where objects are pulled from a hypothetical urn and returned with an additional clone of the object; has a self-reinforcing property ("the rich get richer") <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%B3lya_urn_model">(src)</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Significantly, this construction yields marginal distributions at each time point that can be explicitly characterized and controlled.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What is a marginal distribution? --&gt; the probability of variables without reference to other variables (contrast with conditional distribution) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_distribution">(src)</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Inference is performed using Markov chain Monte Carlo and sequential Monte Carlo methods</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What is inference? --&gt; "deduce properties of an underlying probability distribution." <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference">(src)</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the Markov chain Monte Carlo method? --&gt; "By constructing a Markov chain that has the desired distribution as its equilibrium distribution, one can obtain a sample of the desired distribution by observing the chain after a number of steps. The more steps there are, the more closely the distribution of the sample matches the actual desired distribution." <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo">(src)</a></p>
<ul>
<li>What is a Markov chain? --&gt; "a stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event." <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">(src)</a></li>
<li>What is an equilibrium distribution? --&gt; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain#Steady-state_analysis_and_limiting_distributions">Further reading required to answer this question</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the sequential Monte Carlo method? </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. We demonstrate our models and algorithms on epidemiological and video tracking data.</strong></p>
